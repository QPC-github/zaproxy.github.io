      <description>Active Scan Active scanning attempts to find potential vulnerabilities by using known attacks against the selected targets.
Active scanning is an attack on those targets.
You should NOT use it on web applications that you do not own.
In order to facilitate identifying ZAP traffic and Web Application Firewall exceptions, ZAP is accompanied by a script &amp;ldquo;AddZapHeader.js&amp;rdquo; which can be used to add a specific header to all traffic that passes through or originates from ZAP.</description>

      <description>Configuring Proxies You will need to configure your browser to use ZAP as a proxy.
By default ZAP uses an Address of &amp;lsquo;localhost&amp;rsquo; and a Port of &amp;lsquo;8080&amp;rsquo;, but these can be changed via the Options Local Proxies screen. Instructions for the latest versions of the most commonly used browsers:
Chrome (on Windows)            Press the &amp;lsquo;Customise and control Google Chrome&amp;rsquo; button (top right)    Select the &amp;lsquo;Options.</description>

      <description>Context Alert Filters Context Alert Filters allow you to automatically override the risk levels of any alerts raised by the active and passive scan rules within a context. The Alert Filters will be exported and imported with the context - they will not persist over ZAP sessions unless the context is imported again.
This add-on adds an &amp;lsquo;Alert Filters&amp;rsquo; panel to the contexts dialog.
The panel shows a list of all of the Alert Filters along with buttons for adding, removing, and deleting them.</description>

      <description>Add-ons Add-ons add additional functionality to ZAP.
They have full access to all of the ZAP internals, and so can provide very powerful new features.
You can dynamically install add-ons from the online Add-on Marketplace via the Manage Add-ons dialog.
You can typically add and remove add-ons to and from the ZAP UI without having to restart it.
Add-ons can provide context sensitive help which is dynamically integrated with the help file.</description>

      <description>ZAP makes a limited set of &amp;lsquo;calls home&amp;rsquo;, typically via bitly.com URLs.
Bitly is used so that we get a very limited form of telemetry data without getting access to any sensitive data such as your IP address.
ZAP can be freely downloaded and we get very little feedback from most users - this at least tells us if ZAP is getting more or less popular :)
Check for Updates ZAP makes one request to see if ZAP or any of the add-ons are up to date.</description>

      <description>OK, so this question doesn&#39;t get asked all the time, but it does come up every so often.
So here&#39;s the official response:
Firstly, do you really need ZAP rewritten?
ZAP supports all of the JSR 223 scripting languages, so you can already extend ZAP in a very wide range of scripting languages, including JavaScript, Jython, and Jruby.
Secondly, even if you think you need it rewritten, most ZAP users don&#39;t really care what language it&#39;s written in, they are more concerned about its functionality.</description>

      <description>We rely on people like yourself to translate ZAP into other languages.
If your language is not available then it means that we, the developers, unfortunately don&#39;t speak your language well enough to translate it and no one else has volunteered.
However you can help :)
Get in touch with us if you want to translate ZAP into another language, we&#39;d love to hear from you!
Note that new language files may be available after a new ZAP release has been made available.</description>

      <description>ZAP doesn&#39;t just throw a load of payloads at a target to see what happens :)
The payloads are targeted based on the responses to other payloads so that it hopefully zeros in on specific vulnerabilities.
However there a various options:
 Try out the custom payloads add-on which is supported by some of the existing rules Change the existing rules to improve them - this blog post is a good place to start: Hacking ZAP: Active Scan Rules - if you do improve them then please submit pull requests :) Write new rules to do whatever you want - this gives you full control, but could be a bit daunting to start with Tweak the User defined attacks.</description>

      <description>In this case prevention is definitely better than cure.
By default when you use the ZAP spider and active scanner then ZAP will access all of the URLs, forms, and functionality it can find. If one of those results in your application sending emails then someone is going to get a LOT of emails. (Consider other scenarios like sending orders, HR actions, helpdesk tickets, etc.)
If that has already happened then there is basically nothing you can do in ZAP to prevent those emails from being sent.</description>

      <description>False positives are where ZAP raises alerts for things that are not really vulnerabilities. You should make sure that you understand the potential vulnerability being reported and manually test it before concluding that it is not a real vulnerability.
Please report any false positives that you identify supplying as much information as you can, while obfuscating any sensitive information. This will help us improve ZAP.
Many scan rules support Alert Thresholds and specific Rule Configuration options which allow you to configure some of the conditions under which alerts are reported.</description>

      <guid>/faq/how-do-i-report-a-false-negative/</guid>
      <description>False Negatives are where ZAP fails to identify an issue when it should.
Reporting these problems to us for passive scan rules is straightforward - just let us know the full request and/or response that ZAP should have raised the problem for.
Reporting problems with active scan rules is a bit more tricky, as ZAP will potentially send several requests to detect a specific problem and we need to know how your application responded to each one.</description>

      <description>HTTP Message Processors The HTTP Message Processors can access and change the HTTP messages being fuzzed, control the fuzzing process and interact with the ZAP UI.
Built-in HTTP Message Processors include:
Anti-CSRF Token Refresher Allows to refresh anti-CSRF tokens contained in the request. The anti-CSRF tokens must be properly detected by ZAP to be able to use this processor.
For more information consult the help page &amp;ldquo;Getting Started&amp;rdquo; &amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Features&amp;rdquo; &amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;Anti CSRF Tokens&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Proxying (and therefore passive scanning) requests via ZAP is completely safe and legal, it just allows you to see whats going on.
Spidering is a bit more dangerous. It could cause problems depending on how your application works.
Note that there is an Spider option to not use POST requests - this may be safer but is also likely to reduce the effectiveness of the Spider.
Active scanning is dangerous and depending on your app may create/modify/delete data.</description>

      <description>Release 2.7.0 This is a bug fix and enhancement release, which requires a minimum of Java 8.
Some of the more significant enhancements include:
 Browser launch included by default - this allows you to launch browsers from ZAP that are preconfigured to proxy through ZAP and ignore the certificate warnings due to the ZAP root certificate. Allow ZAP to listen on multiple addresses/ports Support Server Name Indication Updated NTLM engine implementation - this fixes the cases where the domain is being validated and improves interoperability with other (server) NTLM implementations Lots of new API endpoints - see below for details  Note that if you do have any problems with this release then there is also a new &amp;lsquo;Help/Support Info&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo; menu item that provides essential information about your ZAP installation which you should include with any issues you raise.</description>

      <description>Scanner Rules ZAP supports both active and passive scanning rules.
All rules are contained in add-ons so that they can be updated quickly and easily.
By default ZAP ships with just the &amp;lsquo;Release&amp;rsquo; quality rules, but you can install &amp;lsquo;Beta&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Alpha&amp;rsquo; quality rules via the Manage Add-ons dialog.
Scan Policies define which rules run and how they run.
You can have as many scan policies as you like to cover different situations.</description>

      <description>ZAP is a free tool designed to help everyone secure their own websites. Unfortunately this means that other people can use it to attack your website as well.
ZAP is not designed to be a covert tool - it uses various variations of &amp;ldquo;ZAP&amp;rdquo; in its attacks, so if someone does use ZAP to attack your site then this should be apparent in your web server logs.
If someone is using ZAP to attack your site then there are 2 main questions:</description>

Export it into a file.
Import it in to the JRE cacerts keystore.
Assuming the Java keytool is on the system path, JAVA_HOME is set to the location of a JRE and the Zaproxy CA cert is exported to &amp;ldquo;~/owasp_zap_root_ca.cer&amp;rdquo;, then the command is:
 $ keytool -importcert -keystore $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts -file ~/owasp_zap_root_ca.cer -alias owasp_zap_root_ca  When you run your application you&#39;ll need to make sure it&#39;s using ZAP as a proxy.</description>

There are a few steps required to set this up which can be performed via either the UI or the API.
Via the UI:
 Explore your app while proxying through ZAP Login using a valid username and password Define a Context, e.g. by right clicking the top node of your app in the Sites tab and selecting &amp;ldquo;Include in Context&amp;rdquo; Find the &amp;lsquo;Login request&amp;rsquo; in the Sites or History tab Right click it and select &amp;ldquo;Flag as Context&amp;rdquo; / &amp;quot; Form-based Auth Login request&amp;rdquo; Check that the Username and Password parameters are set correctly - they almost certainly wont be!</description>

The logging is configured by the log4j.properties file in the same directory.
By default the &amp;lsquo;main&amp;rsquo; logging levels are set to &amp;ldquo;INFO&amp;rdquo; by these 2 lines:
log4j.logger.org.parosproxy.paros=INFO log4j.logger.org.zaproxy.zap=INFO  Changing these to &amp;ldquo;DEBUG&amp;rdquo; (and restarting ZAP) will significantly increase the amount of logging performed:

      <description>ZAP has no problems scanning applications running on localhost, however there are a couple of things you need to be aware of.
By default ZAP listens on port 8080. If your app also listens on 8080 then you&#39;ll need to change one of them to listen on a different port - it&#39;s probably easier to change ZAP using the Options Local Proxies screen, remember to change your browser&#39;s proxy settings as well: Configuring Proxies.</description>

      <guid>/docs/desktop/releases/2.6.0/</guid>
      <description>Release 2.6.0 This release contains a large number of changes, in particular to the ZAP API.
We have added a significant number of new API endpoints, working towards our goal of making ZAP completely controllable via the API. We have also changed some of the existing endpoints and in all cases these changes are backwards compatible.
The full release also includes a new JxBrowser add-on as well as platform specific webdrivers to make it even easier to interact with ZAP through a wide variety of browsers.</description>

      <description>There are a number of ways to accomplish selective proxying.
1 - Via a Browser Add-on/Extension  Such as FoxyProxy: https://getfoxyproxy.org/  2 - Via Global Excludes  Leveraging Global Excludes you can specify URLs that ZAP should not intercept.  3 - Via a PAC (Proxy Auto-Config) File  You can create your own PAC (Proxy Auto-Config) file and dynamically set proxying as you need, then point your browser at it on your harddrive using the file:/// scheme.</description>

      <description>API ZAP provides an Application Programming Interface (API) which allows you to interact with ZAP programmatically.
The API is available in JSON, HTML and XML formats.
A simple web UI which allows you to explore and use the API is available via the URL http://zap/ when you are proxying via ZAP, or via the host and port ZAP is listening on, eg http://localhost:8080/.
By default only the machine ZAP is running on is able to access the API.</description>

      <description>Authentication ZAP handles multiple types of authentication (called Authentication Methods ) that can be used for websites / webapps. Each Context has an Authentication Method defined which dictates how authentication is handled. The authentication is used to create Web Sessions that correspond to authenticated webapp Users.
In order to detect when response messages from web servers correspond to authenticated requests, a set of indicators can be configured. The Logged in indicator , when present in a response message (either the header or the body), signifies that the response message corresponds to an authenticated request (e.</description>

The solution is easy - use Java 9+
If you need to have multiple versions of Java on Windows then you may find it difficult to specify which one should be used. However changing the last line of the existing zap.bat batch file to specify the path to the right version of Java should solve this problem, e.</description>

      <description>You can use ZAP to perform security regression tests on your own products.
Note that this answer is very basic and WILL need to be improved ;)
You need to have installed Java and ZAP.
To launch ZAP from a Java program you can do something like:
ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder(&amp;#34;/home/myuser/fullpath/ZAP 2.9.0/zap.sh&amp;#34;); // full path to script, use zap.bat on Windows pb.directory(new File(&amp;#34;/home/myuser/fullpath/ZAP 2.9.0/&amp;#34;)); // directory where the script is in Process p = pb.</description>

      <guid>/faq/how-can-you-use-zap-to-scan-apis/</guid>
      <description>ZAP understands API formats like JSON and XML and so can be used to scan APIs.
The problem is usually how to effectively explore the APIs.
There are various options:
 If your API has an OpenAPI/Swagger definition then you can import it using the OpenAPI add-on. If your API has a WSDL then you can import it using the SOAP Scanner add-on. If you have a list of endpoint URLs then you can import these using the Import files containing URLs add-on.</description>

      <guid>/faq/how-can-zap-test-sites-that-use-certificate-pinning/</guid>
      <description>Certificate pinning also known as Public Key Pinning &amp;ldquo;is a mechanism for sites to specify which certificate authorities have issued valid certs for that site, and for user-agents to reject TLS connections to those sites if the certificate is not issued by a known-good CA.&amp;rdquo;
Sites that use certificate pinning will typically not be loaded in your browser if you are proxying it through ZAP.
In Firefox you can change the about:config pref: &amp;lsquo;security.</description>

      <description>The information in this FAQ is based on details from: This user group thread
The Vaadin framework makes heavy use of JavaScript, so it seems the Ajax Spider is the way to go.
As you work to figure things out and get them configured correctly it makes sense to starting by proxying your browser through ZAP, identifying the http session and then flagging it as the &amp;lsquo;active session&amp;rsquo; before starting the Ajax Spider.</description>

      <guid>/faq/why-are-there-missing-history-ids/</guid>
      <description>When you proxy via ZAP you will often see that some of the Ids in the History tab are &amp;lsquo;missing&amp;rsquo;, e.g. it will jump from 1 to 4 etc.
The missing Ids do not refer to &amp;lsquo;hidden&amp;rsquo; requests that ZAP is making.
Instead those requests (which are not sent at all) are generated by ZAP for &amp;ldquo;internal&amp;rdquo; use only. They are used to show a &amp;ldquo;GET&amp;rdquo; request when &amp;ldquo;directory&amp;rdquo; nodes of the &amp;ldquo;Sites&amp;rdquo; tab, not yet (manually) accessed, are selected.</description>

      <description>If the Quick Start Attack fails with the message:
Failed to attack the URL, please check that the URL is valid  then the first thing to do is check your URL in a browser.
If it works ok then open the ZAP Manual Request Editor, replace the default URL with the one you are trying and send the request.
The response may well explain the problem.
Browsers will try variations of a URL that ZAP will not attempt, and we have also seen sites blocking ZAP scans based on the request signature.</description>

      <description>Since version 2.4.1 ZAP has required an API key by default in order to invoke API operations that make changes to ZAP. Since version 2.6.0 an API key is required by default in order to invoke any of the API operations. This is a security feature to prevent malicious sites from invoking the ZAP API. ZAP version 2.6.0 also introduced additional security options. All of the API security options, including the API key, can be found in the API Options screen.</description>

      <description>Contexts Contexts are a way of relating a set of URLs together.
You can define any contexts you like, but it is expected that a context will correspond to a web application.
It is recommended that you define a new contexts for each web application that makes up the system you are testing, and set them in scope as you test each one.
Contexts are defined as a set of regular expressions (regexs) which are applied to all of the URLs in the Sites tab.</description>

      <description>Data Driven Content Data driven content is type of Structural Modifier which identifies URL paths that represent data.
In &amp;lsquo;traditional&amp;rsquo; web applications the structure of the application is typically defined by the URL paths and the data is contained in the URL parameters and POST data.
URLs like:
 https://www.example.com/app/aaa?ddd=eee https://www.example.com/app/aaa?ddd=fff https://www.example.com/app/bbb?ddd=eee  are represented in the Sites tab as two &amp;lsquo;nodes&amp;rsquo; in the tree:
 Sites  https://www.example.com  app  GET:aaa(ddd) GET:bbb(ddd)        The Sites tree is very important as it reflects ZAP&#39;s understanding of the application structure.</description>

      <description>Globally Excluded URLs Globally Excluded URLs are a set of Regular Expressions (regex) that ZAP ignores completely throughout the application. These URLs will not show up in the Proxy, Scanner, or Spider for ZAP. In addition, the URL regexs will be saved in the global configuration for ZAP and not inside of the session file. These URLs will persist between each use of ZAP.
The regex for URLs are configured using the Global Exclude URL screen in the ZAP Options.</description>

Compact (on exit) Allows to compact the database when ZAP is closed, compacting the database ensures a minimal space disk usage but it will also take longer to exit ZAP.
Recovery Log Controls whether or not database&#39;s recovery log is enabled.
Improves the performance of the database when disabled but might lead to data loss if ZAP is exited abruptly.</description>

      <description>Release 2.3.0 The following changes were made in this release:
Significant changes: ZAP ‘lite’ version For this release we are providing a ‘lite’ version of ZAP in addition to the ‘full’ version. This contains exactly the same core code, but it just includes fewer default add-ons. Of course, you can download all of the ‘missing’ add-ons from the ZAP marketplace to ‘upgrade’ the lite version to a full one.
The ‘lite’ version is aimed at people new to security who need less initial functionality which will hopefully be easier to get started with.</description>

      <description>HTTP Sessions This tool keeps track of the existing HTTP Sessions on a particular Site and allows the Zaproxy user to force all requests to be on a particular session. Basically, it allows the user to easily switch between user sessions on a Site and to create a new Session without &amp;ldquo;destroying&amp;rdquo; the existing ones.
It is based on the concept of Session Tokens, which are HTTP message parameters (for now only Cookies) which allow an HTTP server to connect a request message with any previous requests or data stored.</description>

      <description>HTTP Sessions tab This tab shows you the set of identified HTTP sessions for each Site, as detected by the HTTP Sessions extension.
The current Site the information is referring to can be selected via the toolbar or the Sites tab.
The toolbar provides a button (&amp;ldquo;New Session&amp;rdquo;) which allows you to start a new session, forcing all outgoing request messages to be without the session tokens set, so the server considers it&#39;s a new session.</description>

      <description>Options Display screen The Display screen allows you to configure:
Images If ZAP processes images.
Show (local) CONNECT requests If the HTTP CONNECT requests received by the Local Proxies should be persisted in the current session and shown in the History tab. The default is to not show those requests, they happen frequently (in preparation for TLS/SSL, WebSocket&amp;hellip; connections) and, unless inspecting the behaviour of the client application, are not (usually) of much interest.</description>

      <description>Persist Session dialog This dialog is shown by default whenever you start a new session, which always happens when ZAP starts.
It allows you to specify how you would like this session persisted, you can also set the default choice so that you are not prompted again.
Persisting a session means it will be stored in a local database that you can access at a later date.
You do not need to keep &amp;lsquo;saving&amp;rsquo; a session as everything that happens in the session is continually recorded.</description>

      <guid>/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/options/dynsslcert/</guid>
      <description>Option Dynamic SSL Certificates OWASP ZAP allows you to transparently decrypt SSL connections. For doing so, ZAP has to encrypt each request before sending to the server and decrypt each response, which comes back. But, this is already done by the browser. That&#39;s why, the only way to decrypt or intercept the transmission, is to do a &amp;lsquo;man in the middle&amp;rsquo; approach.
Overview In short words, every data send to and received from the server is encrypted/decrypted by using the original server&#39;s certificate inside ZAP.</description>

      <description>Options HTTP Sessions screen This screen allows you to configure the HTTP Sessions Extension&#39;s options:
Default Tokens These are the names of the Cookies that are considered by default to be session tokens. As soon they are detected as parameters on a Site, they are automatically added as session tokens for that Site, unless manually overriden by user command.
The session tokens are used case-insensitive, therefore the default session tokens will automatically be lower-cased.</description>

      <description>Passive Scan ZAP by default passively scans all HTTP messages (requests and responses) sent to the web application being tested.
Passive scanning does not change the requests nor the responses in any way and is therefore safe to use.
Scanning is performed in a background thread to ensure that it does not slow down the exploration of an application.
The (main) behaviour of the passive scanner can be configured using the Options Passive Scanner Screen.</description>

      <description>Spider dialog This dialog launches the spider.
Scope The first tab allows you to select or change the starting point.
If the starting point is in one or more Contexts then you will be able to choose one of them.
If that context has any Users defined then you will be able to select one of them.
If you select one of the users then the spider will be performed as that user, with ZAP (re)authenticating as that user whenever necessary.</description>

Cookie-Based Session Management In the case of this method the session is being tracked through cookies. Currently, the session tokens that are used are imported from the HTTP Sessions Extension.
HTTP Authentication Session Management In the case of this method the session is managed with HTTP request header Authorization.</description>

      <description>Spider The spider is a tool that is used to automatically discover new resources (URLs) on a particular Site. It begins with a list of URLs to visit, called the seeds, which depends on how the Spider is started. The Spider then visits these URLs, it identifies all the hyperlinks in the page and adds them to the list of URLs to visit and the process continues recursively as long as new resources are found.</description>

      <description>Structural Modifiers Structural Modifiers are controls which change how ZAP represents the structure of the application.
The Sites tab show ZAP&#39;s representation of the application.
If it is not a good representation of the structure then ZAP will not be able to attack the application effectively.
There are currently 2 types of Structural Modifiers:
 Data Driven Content which identify URL paths that represent data Structural Parameters which identify parameters that represent application structure instead of user data  Structural Modifiers can only be applied to Contexts.</description>

      <description>Users Users are the ZAP representations of websites/webapps&amp;rsquo; users. They allow certain actions to be performed from the point of view of an user of the webapps. For each Context, a set of Users can be defined, which can then be used in actions related to the context. Most commonly, during various scans the request messages can be sent from the point of view of a User.
The concept of Users is tightly tied to the concepts of Session Management and Authentication.</description>

      <description>GraphQL Schemas can be very large and testing them can be a very time-consuming process. Currently, there is a lack of tools that allow developers to launch and automate attacks on these endpoints. The GraphQL add-on for ZAP intends to fill this gap.
The add-on is still in an early stage, so the range of its functionality is limited. However, you can combine it with existing ZAP functionality to abuse GraphQL endpoints in many different ways.</description>

      <description>Name: Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set Type: Passive Scan Rule Description Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.</description>

      <description>Name: Cookie Without SameSite Attribute Type: Passive Scan Rule Description A cookie has been set without the SameSite attribute, which means that the cookie can be sent as a result of a &amp;lsquo;cross-site&amp;rsquo; request. The SameSite attribute is an effective counter measure to cross-site request forgery, cross-site script inclusion, and timing attacks.
Solution Ensure that the SameSite attribute is set to either &amp;lsquo;lax&amp;rsquo; or ideally &amp;lsquo;strict&amp;rsquo; for all cookies.

      <description>Name: Cross Site Scripting (Reflected) Type: Active Scan Rule Risk: High Description Cross-site Scripting (XSS) is an attack technique that involves echoing attacker-supplied code into a user&#39;s browser instance. A browser instance can be a standard web browser client, or a browser object embedded in a software product such as the browser within WinAmp, an RSS reader, or an email client. The code itself is usually written in HTML/JavaScript, but may also extend to VBScript, ActiveX, Java, Flash, or any other browser-supported technology.</description>

      <description>Name: HTTP Parameter Pollution Type: Active Scan Rule Risk: Informational Description HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) attacks consist of injecting encoded query string delimiters into other existing parameters. If a web application does not properly sanitize the user input, a malicious user can compromise the logic of the application to perform either client-side or server-side attacks. One consequence of HPP attacks is that the attacker can potentially override existing hard-coded HTTP parameters to modify the behavior of an application, bypass input validation checkpoints, and access and possibly exploit variables that may be out of direct reach.</description>

      <description>Name: Insecure HTTP Method Type: Active Scan Rule Risk: Medium Description The most common methodology for attackers is to first footprint the target&#39;s web presence and enumerate as much information as possible. With this information, the attacker may develop an accurate attack scenario, which will effectively exploit a vulnerability in the software type/version being utilized by the target host.
Multi-tier fingerprinting is similar to its predecessor, TCP/IP Fingerprinting (with a scanner such as Nmap) except that it is focused on the Application Layer of the OSI model instead of the Transport Layer.</description>

      <description>Name: Loosely Scoped Cookie Type: Passive Scan Rule Description Cookies can be scoped by domain or path. This check is only concerned with domain scope.The domain scope applied to a cookie determines which domains can access it. For example, a cookie can be scoped strictly to a subdomain e.g. www.nottrusted.com, or loosely scoped to a parent domain e.g. nottrusted.com. In the latter case, any subdomain of nottrusted.com can access the cookie.</description>

      <description>Name: Relative Path Confusion Type: Active Scan Rule Risk: Medium Description The web server is configured to serve responses to ambiguous URLs in a manner that is likely to lead to confusion about the correct &amp;ldquo;relative path&amp;rdquo; for the URL. Resources (CSS, images, etc.) are also specified in the page response using relative, rather than absolute URLs. In an attack, if the web browser parses the &amp;ldquo;cross-content&amp;rdquo; response in a permissive manner, or can be tricked into permissively parsing the &amp;ldquo;cross-content&amp;rdquo; response, using techniques such as framing, then the web browser may be fooled into interpreting HTML as CSS (or other content types), leading to an XSS vulnerability.</description>

      <description>Name: Session Fixation Type: Active Scan Rule Risk: High Description Session Fixation may be possible. If this issue occurs with a login URL (where the user authenticates themselves to the application), then the URL may be given by an attacker, along with a fixed session id, to a victim, in order to later assume the identity of the victim using the given session id. If the issue occurs with a non-login page, the URL and fixed session id may only be used by an attacker to track an unauthenticated user&#39;s actions.</description>

      <description>Name: X-ChromeLogger-Data (XCOLD) Header Information Leak Type: Passive Scan Rule Description The server is leaking information through the X-ChromeLogger-Data (or X-ChromePhp-Data) response header. The content of such headers can be customized by the developer, however it is not uncommon to find: server file system locations, vhost declarations, etc.
Solution Disable this functionality in Production when it might leak information that could be leveraged by an attacker. Alternatively ensure that use of the functionality is tied to a strong authorization check and only available to administrators or support personnel for troubleshooting purposes not general users.</description>

      <description>Name: X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing Type: Passive Scan Rule Description The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to &amp;lsquo;nosniff&amp;rsquo;. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.</description>

      <description>Name: X-Debug-Token Information Leak Type: Passive Scan Rule Description The response contained an X-Debug-Token or X-Debug-Token-Link header. This indicates that Symfony&#39;s Profiler may be in use and exposing sensitive data.
Solution Limit access to Symfony&#39;s Profiler, either via authentication/authorization or limiting inclusion of the header to specific clients (by IP, etc.).

      <description>Name: X-Frame-Options Header Not Set Type: Passive Scan Rule Risk: Medium Description X-Frame-Options header is not included in the HTTP response to protect against &amp;lsquo;ClickJacking&amp;rsquo; attacks.
Solution Most modern Web browsers support the X-Frame-Options HTTP header. Ensure it&#39;s set on all web pages returned by your site (if you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it&#39;s part of a FRAMESET) then you&#39;ll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY.</description>

      <description>Name: XML External Entity Attack Type: Active Scan Rule Risk: High Description This technique takes advantage of a feature of XML to build documents dynamically at the time of processing. An XML message can either provide data explicitly or by pointing to an URI where the data exists. In the attack technique, external entities may replace the entity value with malicious data, alternate referrals or may compromise the security of the data the server/XML application has access to.</description>

      <description>Name: XPath Injection Type: Active Scan Rule Risk: High Description XPath Injection is an attack technique used to exploit applications that construct XPath (XML Path Language) queries from user-supplied input to query or navigate XML documents. It can be used directly by an application to query an XML document, as part of a larger operation such as applying an XSLT transformation to an XML document, or applying an XQuery to an XML document.</description>

      <description>ZAP full scan GitHub action provides free dynamic application security testing (DAST) of your web applications. DAST is also known as black-box testing, which allows ZAP to identify potential vulnerabilities in your web applications. We previously introduced the ZAP baseline scan GitHub action to passively identify potential alerts in a web application. However, unlike the baseline scan, ZAP full scan attacks the web application to find additional vulnerabilities.
The ZAP full scan action runs the ZAP spider against the specified target (by default with no time limit) followed by an optional ajax spider scan and then a full active scan before reporting the results.</description>

      <description>Did you know that you or your company/organization could customize the generic details of the alerts that ZAP raises?
Alerts raised by ZAP contain a variety of information, some generic, some specific to the issue at hand. Specific details may include things such as URL, parameter, values, etc. While generic details include things like a description, solution, and links to related background material and resources.
Using &amp;lsquo;Alert Overrides&amp;rsquo; functionality you can replace or add generic information, allowing you to include details that may be more relevant to your company or organization.</description>

      <description>Type: Passive Scan Description Based on passive analysis of the response, insecure component {0} {1} appears to be in use. The highest noted CVSS rating for this product version is {2}. In total, {3} vulnerabilities were noted. Some Linux distributions such as Red Hat employ the practice of retaining old version numbers when security fixes are &amp;ldquo;backported&amp;rdquo;. These cases are noted as &amp;ldquo;False Positives&amp;rdquo;, but should be manually verified.
Solution Upgrade from {0} {1} to the latest stable version of the product.</description>

      <description>With the increasing number of web application security breaches, it is essential to keep your web application secure at all times. Furthermore having security integrated into your CI/CD pipeline (DevSecOps) will become a lifesaver if you are actively developing the application. To cater to this need ZAP provides a baseline scan feature to find common security faults in a web application without doing any active attacks.
GitHub Actions make it easier to automate how to scan and secure web applications at scale.</description>

      <title>Is ZAP the World’s most Popular Web Scanner?</title>
      <link>/blog/2020-04-02-is-zap-the-worlds-most-popular-web-scanner/</link>

      <guid>/blog/2020-04-02-is-zap-the-worlds-most-popular-web-scanner/</guid>
      <description>I’ve stated that ZAP is the world’s most popular free and open source web application scanner on stage at security conferences around the world for many years. No one has ever contradicted me so it must be true :)
However I’ve started to wonder if ZAP is actually more popular than most if not all of the commercial scanners as well?
That is actually pretty hard to tell - ZAP is a free tool that anyone can download, so determining how many users we really have is difficult.</description>

      <guid>/blog/2020-03-09-zap-ssrf-setup/</guid>
      <description>Some vulnerabilities can only be found by sending payloads that cause a callback to the tester. One example is XXE vulnerabilities when the XML rendering result is not available to the user. ZAP can find these vulnerabilities that depend on SSRF detection but the target system needs to be able to reach the ZAP callback endpoint. In many cases the computer running ZAP is behind some kind of NAT and doesn’t have a public IP so it will not receive the expected callbacks and miss some of the existent vulnerabilities.</description>

      <description>This document gives an overview of the automatic and manual components provided by OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) that are recommended for testing each of the OWASP Top Ten Project 2017 risks.
Note that the OWASP Top Ten Project risks cover a wide range of underlying vulnerabilities, some of which are not really possible to test for in a completely automated way. If a completely automated tool claims to protect you against the full OWASP Top Ten then you can be sure they are being ‘economical with the truth’!</description>

      <description>We have just released a new feature for ZAP that allows you to launch browsers from within ZAP. The browsers are automatically configured to proxy via ZAP and ignore certificate warnings, making it much easier for people to get started with ZAP as well as for more experienced users who want to use ZAP with a variety of browsers. You can install and use Browser Launch right now via the ZAP Marketplace, which can be accessed via the &amp;lsquo;Manage Add-ons&amp;rsquo; button in ZAP:</description>

      <description>The previous ZAP blog post explained how you could Explore APIs with ZAP.
This blog post goes one step further, and explains how you can both explore and perform security scanning of APIs using ZAP from the command line.
This allows you to easily automate the scanning of your APIs.
Following the approach taken by the Baseline Scan we have introduced a new API scanning script which has only one dependency – Docker.</description>

      <guid>/blog/2017-04-03-exploring-apis-with-zap/</guid>
      <description>APIs can be challenging for security testing for a variety of reasons.
The first problem you will encounter is how to effectively explore an API - most APIs cannot be explored using browsing or standard spidering techniques.
However many APIs are described using technologies such as:
 SOAP OpenAPI / Swagger  These standards define the API endpoints and can be imported into ZAP using 2 optional add-ons.
Installing the add-ons In order to import the API definitions you will need to add the relevant add-ons from the ZAP Marketplace.</description>

      <guid>/blog/2017-02-06-introducing-the-jxbrowser-add-on-for-zap/</guid>
      <description>As modern web applications are increasing their reliance on JavaScript, security tools that do not understand JavaScript will not be able to work effectively with them. ZAP already has components like the Ajax Spider and DOM XSS scanner that work by launching browsers and controlling them via Selenium, and we are planning to make much more use of browsers in the future.
To that end we are planning on releasing a new ZAP add-on which will contain JxBrowser, a wrapper around Chromium.</description>

We would love to have more ZAP unit tests, and we are therefore launching a Unit Test Bounty program, where we pay for unit tests for specific areas of the ZAP codebase.
We are going to start with the passive scan rules (release and beta quality).

      <description>Introduction Welcome to the second ZAP Newsletter.
And apologies for the delay - 2.4.3 took longer than expected, and last week I was away at a Mozilla work week.
News The big news is that ZAP 2.4.3 is now available to download.
This is a development and bugfix release, for more details of all of the changes see the release notes.
In other news, you can now buy ZAP stickers on StickerMule (UPDATE: no longer available).</description>

      <description>At OWASP AppSec EU in Amsterdam this year I announced ZAP as a Service (ZaaS).
The slides are here and the video will hopefully be available soon.
The idea behind this development is to enhance ZAP so that it can be run in a ‘server’ mode.
This is different to the current ‘daemon’ mode in that it will be designed to be a long running, highly scalable, distributed service accessed by multiple users with different roles.</description>

      <description>Hello everybody, my name is Alberto Verza, a 23 year student from Spain, and this summer I have participated in Google Summer of Code 2014. My project was the SOAP Scanner add-on for ZAP, in which I worked during all the Program. Let me explain you the features it includes.
One of the interesting features this add-on provides is WSDL file scanning. Until now, ZAP could find these kind of files and it could even search URLs inside them, but further petitions to these URLs had not a valid SOAP format specified by the WSDL file.</description>

      <description>Welcome to a series of blog posts aimed at helping you “hack the ZAP source code”.
The previous post in this series is: Hacking ZAP #3 - Passive scan rules
Active scan rules are another relatively simple way to enhance ZAP. Active scan rules attack the server, and therefore are only run when explicitly invoked by the user. You should only use active scan rules against applications that you have permission to attack.</description>

      <description>Welcome to a series of blog posts aimed at helping you “hack the ZAP source code”.
The previous post in this series is: Hacking ZAP #2 - Getting Started
One of the easiest ways to enhance ZAP is to write new passive scan rules.
Passive scan rules are used to warn the user of potential vulnerabilities that can be detected passively - they are not allowed to make any new requests or manipulate the requests or responses in any way.</description>

      <description>Welcome to a series of blog posts aimed at helping you “hack the ZAP source code”.
The previous post in this series is: Hacking ZAP #1 - Why should you?
In order to change the ZAP source code you will need to set up a development environment.
Requirements The following software is used/required to obtain and build ZAP (core) and the add-ons:
 A JDK (minimum version 8), for example, Zulu JDK or AdoptOpenJDK; Git, to obtain the source code; Gradle, to build the source code.</description>

      <description>Welcome to a series of blog posts aimed at helping you “hack the ZAP source code”.
ZAP is an open source tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications. It is the most active OWASP project and is very community focused - it probably has more contributors than any other web application security tool. It is being continually enhanced and, unusually for a security tool, has been translated into over 25 languages thanks to over 70 translators.</description>

      <description>We are getting close to releasing the next major version of ZAP.
As there are so many changes we&#39;ve decided to go to version 2.0.0 rather than 1.5, and some of the biggest changes have come about thanks to the Google Summer of Code (GSoC).
This is the first year in which ZAP has taken part in the GSoC, and it has been a resounding success.
In this post I&#39;ll give you an overview of the 3 GSoC projects, and an easy way to try them out if you can&#39;t wait for the full release.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been struggling with the question of ZAP releases.
We&#39;ve made loads of enhancements to ZAP recently, and I want them to be available to as wide an audience as possible.
But I also want to make sure our &amp;lsquo;full&amp;rsquo; releases remain as robust and stable as possible.
I want to get the next full release (2.0.0) out of the door asap, but I still want to get a load more features into it.</description>

      <description>The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (otherwise known as ZAP) is a free security tool which you can use to find security vulnerabilities in web applications. My name is Simon Bennetts, and I am the ZAP Project Leader; there is also an international group of volunteers who develop and support it. Future posts on this blog will describe the features that ZAP provides and how you can use them, but this post will concentrate on the philosophy behind ZAP.</description>

      <description>Overview This guide is intended to serve as a basic introduction for using ZAP to perform security testing, even if you don’t have a background in security testing. To that end, some security testing concepts and terminology is included but this document is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to either ZAP or security testing.
It is also available as a pdf to make it easier to print.
Security Testing Basics Software security testing is the process of assessing and testing a system to discover security risks and vulnerabilities of the system and its data.</description>

      <description>The following students have completed projects which have significantly improved ZAP.
To qualify for this list students must complete a non trivial project and have their work either included in the ZAP core or in an add-on that has been published on the Marketplace. Projects that are not published by the time the students have finished can still qualify to be included if someone else completes their work and publishes it for them.</description>

The following views are included by default:
           Text The data in text format    Hex A table showing the hex representation of all of the characters in the header and body. For editable screens this allows you to add control characters via their hex codes.</description>

      <description>The ZAP API scan is a script that is available in the ZAP Docker images.
It is tuned for performing scans against APIs defined by OpenAPI via either a local file or a URL.
It imports the definition that you specify and then runs an Active Scan against the URLs found. The Active Scan is tuned to APIs, so it doesn&#39;t bother looking for things like XSSs.
It also includes 2 scripts that:</description>

      <description>The ZAP Baseline scan is a script that is available in the ZAP Docker images.
It runs the ZAP spider against the specified target for (by default) 1 minute and then waits for the passive scanning to complete before reporting the results.
This means that the script doesn&#39;t perform any actual &amp;lsquo;attacks&amp;rsquo; and will run for a relatively short period of time (a few minutes at most).
By default it reports all alerts as WARNings but you can specify a config file which can change any rules to FAIL or IGNORE.</description>

      <description>The ZAP full scan is a script that is available in the ZAP Docker images.
It runs the ZAP spider against the specified target (by default with no time limit) followed by an optional ajax spider scan and then a full active scan before reporting the results.
This means that the script does perform actual &amp;lsquo;attacks&amp;rsquo; and can potentially run for a long period of time.
By default it reports all alerts as WARNings but you can specify a config file which can change any rules to FAIL or IGNORE.</description>

      <description>Scan Hooks To make it easy to make little tweaks here and there a hook system is in place to help you. It enables you to override or modify behaviour of the script components instead of having to write a new script.
Use Cases Modifying Args
For the AJAX crawler you may want to target a suburl with a specific hash (http://example.com vs http://example.com/#/dashboard). You can use the zap_ajax_spider hook to intercept the arguments and modify them.</description>
