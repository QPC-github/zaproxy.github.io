      <description>We measure and record a range of statistics related to ZAP, some of which are made public here.
The blog post: Collecting Statistics for Open Source Projects explains how this all works.
Check for Updates The number of Check for Update requests received per month. From 2.9.0 the suffix &amp;#39;d&amp;#39; indicates ZAP is running as a daemon rather than the desktop.</description>

      <description>These were the alerts most frequently flagged as false positives using Alert Filters last month.
Note that this does not necessarily mean they are false positives, it could mean that the people using ZAP are not interested in these specific vulnerabilities.

      <description>Some stats are shown for all pings and for desktop only pings. The desktop pings show a significantly different profile, possibly because many automated ZAP scans run in the cloud and many cloud providers are located in the USA. We also know that quite a few companies run ZAP as a SaaS offering which will also skew the stats.</description>

      <description>These were the most frequently installed optional add-ons last month.
Note that this does not mean they were the most used add-ons - that is harder to quantify.
