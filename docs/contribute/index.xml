      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s always lots of coding to be done!
This can be one of the most rewarding ways to contribute to ZAP - just look at the ZAP Student Hall of Fame to see how many students have made major contributions to ZAP and where it&amp;rsquo;s led them.
You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a student of course, anyone who know is interested will be able to help us out with the ZAP code base.</description>

      <description>The Core Team is the set of people who have made the most significant contributions to the most recent ZAP releases. It is also a team - we work together in a collaborative way to make ZAP a better project as per the Mission Statement.
Decisions are made as a group, no one person makes the final decision - either we all agree or we work out a way to ensure everyone is happy with a given approach.</description>

      <description>Documentation is very important, and while we have tried to make the ZAP documentation as useful as possible we know that it still needs to be improved.
The latest ZAP docs are now all available on this site but the source of those pages does vary.
Website Pages  The source for the main website pages is under https://github.</description>

      <description>If you are having problems with ZAP then it is always best to first look at the FAQ: Somethings not working. What should I do?.
In particular:
 Check the Frequently Asked Questions Search the ZAP User Group posts Search the existing issues  Raising an Issue  If you have found a new bug then raise a new issue.</description>

      <description>Liking, following or staring ZAP resources really helps raise ZAP&amp;rsquo;s profile - what could be an easier way to contribute?
We also love seeing articles about ZAP on other sites, just don&amp;rsquo;t forget to tell us about them!</description>

      <description>We believe that security tools should be available to everyone, which is why ZAP is one of the very few security tools that is both fully internationalised and translated into many languages.
ZAP Desktop  You can help translate the ZAP Desktop via the Crowdin: zaproxy project.
You can signup to Crowdin for free, and if you&amp;rsquo;d like to translate ZAP to a language not on the list then let us know and we&amp;rsquo;ll add it in.</description>
