      <description>AJAX Spider dialog This dialog launches the AJAX Spider.
Scope The first tab allows you to change key features like:
Starting Point The URL which the AJAX spider will start crawling from, or a context (in which case it will be used one of the URLs that are in context as starting point).
Context Allows to select the Context to be spidered.
User Allows to select one of the users available from the selected context, to perform the spider scan as a user (ZAP will (re)authenticate as that user whenever necessary).</description>

      <description>Options AJAX Spider screen This screen allows you to configure the AJAX Spider options. The AJAX Spider is an add-on for a crawler called Crawljax. The add-on sets up a local proxy in ZAP to talk to Crawljax. The AJAX Spider allows you to crawl web applications written in AJAX in far more depth than the native Spider. Use the AJAX Spider if you may have web applications written in AJAX.</description>
