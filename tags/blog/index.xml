      <description>On September 6th 2010 I posted this message to Bugtraq: Title - The Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) version 1.0.0. From those very humble beginnings ZAP has now become what we believe is the world’s most frequently used web application scanner.</description>

      <description>With the popularity of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) there comes the need to secure their use so that they are not misused because of bad configuration, older libraries, or buggy implementations. So the JWT Support add-on is used to find such vulnerabilities and this blog explains on how to use it.</description>

      <title>Introducing the GraphQL Add-on for ZAP</title>
      <link>/blog/2020-08-28-introducing-the-graphql-add-on-for-zap/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/blog/2020-08-28-introducing-the-graphql-add-on-for-zap/</guid>
      <description>GraphQL Schemas can be very large and testing them can be a very time-consuming process. Currently, there is a lack of tools that allow developers to launch and automate attacks on these endpoints. The GraphQL add-on for ZAP intends to fill this gap.
The add-on is still in an early stage, so the range of its functionality is limited.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Application Security Testing with ZAP and GitHub Actions</title>
      <link>/blog/2020-05-15-dynamic-application-security-testing-with-zap-and-github-actions/</link>

      <guid>/blog/2020-05-15-dynamic-application-security-testing-with-zap-and-github-actions/</guid>
      <description>ZAP full scan GitHub action provides free dynamic application security testing (DAST) of your web applications. DAST is also known as black-box testing, which allows ZAP to identify potential vulnerabilities in your web applications. We previously introduced the ZAP baseline scan GitHub action to passively identify potential alerts in a web application.</description>

      <title>Customize Alert Details</title>

      <description>Did you know that you or your company/organization could customize the generic details of the alerts that ZAP raises?
Alerts raised by ZAP contain a variety of information, some generic, some specific to the issue at hand. Specific details may include things such as URL, parameter, values, etc. While generic details include things like a description, solution, and links to related background material and resources.</description>

      <link>/blog/2020-04-09-automate-security-testing-with-zap-and-github-actions/</link>

      <guid>/blog/2020-04-09-automate-security-testing-with-zap-and-github-actions/</guid>
      <description>With the increasing number of web application security breaches, it is essential to keep your web application secure at all times. Furthermore having security integrated into your CI/CD pipeline (DevSecOps) will become a lifesaver if you are actively developing the application. To cater to this need ZAP provides a baseline scan feature to find common security faults in a web application without doing any active attacks.</description>

      <title>Is ZAP the World’s most Popular Web Scanner?</title>
      <link>/blog/2020-04-02-is-zap-the-worlds-most-popular-web-scanner/</link>

      <guid>/blog/2020-04-02-is-zap-the-worlds-most-popular-web-scanner/</guid>
      <description>I’ve stated that ZAP is the world’s most popular free and open source web application scanner on stage at security conferences around the world for many years. No one has ever contradicted me so it must be true :)
However I’ve started to wonder if ZAP is actually more popular than most if not all of the commercial scanners as well?</description>

      <title>ZAP SSRF Setup</title>
      <link>/blog/2020-03-09-zap-ssrf-setup/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/blog/2020-03-09-zap-ssrf-setup/</guid>
      <description>Some vulnerabilities can only be found by sending payloads that cause a callback to the tester. One example is XXE vulnerabilities when the XML rendering result is not available to the user. ZAP can find these vulnerabilities that depend on SSRF detection but the target system needs to be able to reach the ZAP callback endpoint.</description>
