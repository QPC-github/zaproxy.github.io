      <description>The new Automation Framework will in time replace the Command Line and Packaged Scan options. It allows you to control ZAP via one YAML file and provides more flexibility while not being tied to any specific container technology.
To use the Automation Framework with ZAP 2.10.0 install the Automation Framework add-on and update the rest of the add-ons that you have installed.</description>

      <description>This document gives an overview of the automatic and manual components provided by OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) that are recommended for testing each of the OWASP Top Ten Project 2017 risks.
Note that the OWASP Top Ten Project risks cover a wide range of underlying vulnerabilities, some of which are not really possible to test for in a completely automated way.</description>

      <description>The ZAP API scan is a script that is available in the ZAP Docker images.
It is tuned for performing scans against APIs defined by OpenAPI, SOAP, or GraphQL via either a local file or a URL.
It imports the definition that you specify and then runs an Active Scan against the URLs found.</description>

      <title>ZAP - Baseline Scan</title>

      <guid>/docs/docker/baseline-scan/</guid>
      <description>The ZAP Baseline scan is a script that is available in the ZAP Docker images.
It runs the ZAP spider against the specified target for (by default) 1 minute and then waits for the passive scanning to complete before reporting the results.
This means that the script doesn&#39;t perform any actual &amp;lsquo;attacks&amp;rsquo; and will run for a relatively short period of time (a few minutes at most).</description>

      <description>The ZAP full scan is a script that is available in the ZAP Docker images.
It runs the ZAP spider against the specified target (by default with no time limit) followed by an optional ajax spider scan and then a full active scan before reporting the results.
This means that the script does perform actual &amp;lsquo;attacks&amp;rsquo; and can potentially run for a long period of time.</description>

      <description>Scan Hooks To make it easy to make little tweaks here and there a hook system is in place to help you. It enables you to override or modify behaviour of the script components instead of having to write a new script.
Use Cases Modifying Args
For the AJAX crawler you may want to target a suburl with a specific hash (http://example.</description>
