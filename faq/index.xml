      <description>Somethings not working as you expect with ZAP, and you&#39;re not sure if it&#39;s a bug or a misunderstanding of how ZAP works.
The following steps may well help:
Check for updates Click on the &amp;lsquo;Manage Add-ons&amp;rsquo; button on the toolbar and then click on the &amp;lsquo;Check for updates&amp;rsquo; button.
Note that there will not be a &amp;lsquo;Check for updates&amp;rsquo; button if you&#39;ve configured ZAP to check on startup (which is recommended).</description>

      <guid>/faq/how-do-i-get-a-specific-feature-implemented-in-zap/</guid>
      <description>You have 3 options:
 Convince one of the existing ZAP developers that they should implement it Convince someone else to implement it for you Implement it yourself  Some of the ZAP core developers are paid to work on ZAP. If you can convince one of the us that we should implement it asap then this will probably be the quickest option as obviously we know the code base well.</description>

      <guid>/faq/what-calls-home-does-zap-make/</guid>
      <description>ZAP makes a limited set of &amp;lsquo;calls home&amp;rsquo;, typically via bitly.com URLs.
Bitly is used so that we get a very limited form of telemetry data without getting access to any sensitive data such as your IP address.
ZAP can be freely downloaded and we get very little feedback from most users - this at least tells us if ZAP is getting more or less popular :)
Check for Updates ZAP makes one request to see if ZAP or any of the add-ons are up to date.</description>

      <description>ZAP is installed in different places depending on the OS:
Windows 7 Underneath the &amp;lsquo;Program Files (x86)&amp;rsquo; directory, e.g.
C:\Program Files (x86)\OWASP\Zed Attack Proxy  Windows XP Underneath the &amp;lsquo;Program Files&amp;rsquo; directory, e.g.
C:\Program Files\OWASP\Zed Attack Proxy  Linux The Linux package is actually just a tar.gz file, so ZAP will be &amp;lsquo;installed&amp;rsquo; wherever you expand the archive.
Mac OS Same as for Linux, the Mac OS package is just a zip file.</description>

      <title>Why don&#39;t you rewrite ZAP in &lt;my favorite language&gt;?</title>
      <link>/faq/why-dont-you-rewrite-zap-in-my-favorite-language/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/faq/why-dont-you-rewrite-zap-in-my-favorite-language/</guid>
      <description>OK, so this question doesn&#39;t get asked all the time, but it does come up every so often.
So here&#39;s the official response:
Firstly, do you really need ZAP rewritten?
ZAP supports all of the JSR 223 scripting languages, so you can already extend ZAP in a very wide range of scripting languages, including JavaScript, Jython, and Jruby.
Secondly, even if you think you need it rewritten, most ZAP users don&#39;t really care what language it&#39;s written in, they are more concerned about its functionality.</description>

      <guid>/faq/why-is-zap-not-available-in-my-language/</guid>
      <description>We rely on people like yourself to translate ZAP into other languages.
If your language is not available then it means that we, the developers, unfortunately don&#39;t speak your language well enough to translate it and no one else has volunteered.
However you can help :)
Get in touch with us if you want to translate ZAP into another language, we&#39;d love to hear from you!
Note that new language files may be available after a new ZAP release has been made available.</description>

      <title>How can I add my own payloads to active scan rules?</title>

      <guid>/faq/how-can-i-add-my-own-payloads-to-active-scan-rules/</guid>
      <description>ZAP doesn&#39;t just throw a load of payloads at a target to see what happens :)
The payloads are targeted based on the responses to other payloads so that it hopefully zeros in on specific vulnerabilities.
However there a various options:
 Try out the custom payloads add-on which is supported by some of the existing rules Change the existing rules to improve them - this blog post is a good place to start: Hacking ZAP: Active Scan Rules - if you do improve them then please submit pull requests :) Write new rules to do whatever you want - this gives you full control, but could be a bit daunting to start with Tweak the User defined attacks.</description>

      <title>How can I prevent ZAP from sending me 1000s of emails via a &#39;Contact Us&#39; form?</title>
      <link>/faq/how-can-i-prevent-zap-from-sending-me-1000s-of-emails-via-a-contact-us-form/</link>

      <guid>/faq/how-can-i-prevent-zap-from-sending-me-1000s-of-emails-via-a-contact-us-form/</guid>
      <description>In this case prevention is definitely better than cure.
By default when you use the ZAP spider and active scanner then ZAP will access all of the URLs, forms, and functionality it can find. If one of those results in your application sending emails then someone is going to get a LOT of emails. (Consider other scenarios like sending orders, HR actions, helpdesk tickets, etc.)
If that has already happened then there is basically nothing you can do in ZAP to prevent those emails from being sent.</description>

      <title>How do I handle a False Positive?</title>
      <link>/faq/how-do-i-handle-a-false-positive/</link>

      <guid>/faq/how-do-i-handle-a-false-positive/</guid>
      <description>False positives are where ZAP raises alerts for things that are not really vulnerabilities. You should make sure that you understand the potential vulnerability being reported and manually test it before concluding that it is not a real vulnerability.
Please report any false positives that you identify supplying as much information as you can, while obfuscating any sensitive information. This will help us improve ZAP.
Many scan rules support Alert Thresholds and specific Rule Configuration options which allow you to configure some of the conditions under which alerts are reported.</description>

      <guid>/faq/how-do-i-report-a-false-negative/</guid>
      <description>False Negatives are where ZAP fails to identify an issue when it should.
Reporting these problems to us for passive scan rules is straightforward - just let us know the full request and/or response that ZAP should have raised the problem for.
Reporting problems with active scan rules is a bit more tricky, as ZAP will potentially send several requests to detect a specific problem and we need to know how your application responded to each one.</description>

      <title>Is there any danger when scanning with ZAP against a live website (e.g. create/delete/update/corrupt data)?</title>
      <link>/faq/is-there-any-danger-when-scanning-with-zap-against-a-live-website-e-g-create-delete-update-corrupt-data/</link>

      <guid>/faq/is-there-any-danger-when-scanning-with-zap-against-a-live-website-e-g-create-delete-update-corrupt-data/</guid>
      <description>Proxying (and therefore passive scanning) requests via ZAP is completely safe and legal, it just allows you to see whats going on.
Spidering is a bit more dangerous. It could cause problems depending on how your application works.
Note that there is an Spider option to not use POST requests - this may be safer but is also likely to reduce the effectiveness of the Spider.
Active scanning is dangerous and depending on your app may create/modify/delete data.</description>

      <guid>/faq/someone-is-using-zap-to-attack-my-website-what-should-i-do/</guid>
      <description>ZAP is a free tool designed to help everyone secure their own websites. Unfortunately this means that other people can use it to attack your website as well.
ZAP is not designed to be a covert tool - it uses various variations of &amp;ldquo;ZAP&amp;rdquo; in its attacks, so if someone does use ZAP to attack your site then this should be apparent in your web server logs.
If someone is using ZAP to attack your site then there are 2 main questions:</description>

      <description>If ZAP fails to detect a known problem then please let us know!
Obviously the more information you can give us the better, and the best option would be a simple one page &amp;lsquo;proof of concept&amp;rsquo; in the form of a wavsep test - we can then include those in our regression tests.

      <description>By default ZAP will now also only allow connections from the local machine. You can set which IP addresses can connect to the API using the command line:
-config api.addrs.addr.name=123.456.789.123  If you are using ZAP in a completely isolated environment you can allow all IP addresses to connect to the ZAP API using:
-config api.addrs.addr.name=.* -config api.addrs.addr.regex=true  You will also need to set or disable the API key - see the FAQ: Why is an API key required by default?</description>

      <description>You&#39;ll need to generate a dynamic root CA certificate.
Export it into a file.
Import it in to the JRE cacerts keystore.
Assuming the Java keytool is on the system path, JAVA_HOME is set to the location of a JRE and the Zaproxy CA cert is exported to &amp;ldquo;~/owasp_zap_root_ca.cer&amp;rdquo;, then the command is:
 $ keytool -importcert -keystore $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts -file ~/owasp_zap_root_ca.cer -alias owasp_zap_root_ca  When you run your application you&#39;ll need to make sure it&#39;s using ZAP as a proxy.</description>

      <description>ZAP supports form based authentication, and can automatically (re)authenticate, for example when using the Spider or Active Scanner.
There are a few steps required to set this up which can be performed via either the UI or the API.
Via the UI:
 Explore your app while proxying through ZAP Login using a valid username and password Define a Context, e.g. by right clicking the top node of your app in the Sites tab and selecting &amp;ldquo;Include in Context&amp;rdquo; Find the &amp;lsquo;Login request&amp;rsquo; in the Sites or History tab Right click it and select &amp;ldquo;Flag as Context&amp;rdquo; / &amp;quot; Form-based Auth Login request&amp;rdquo; Check that the Username and Password parameters are set correctly - they almost certainly wont be!</description>

      <description>ZAP logs to a file called &amp;ldquo;zap.log&amp;rdquo; in the ZAP &amp;lsquo;home&amp;rsquo; directory.
The logging is configured by the log4j.properties file in the same directory.
By default the &amp;lsquo;main&amp;rsquo; logging levels are set to &amp;ldquo;INFO&amp;rdquo; by these 2 lines:
log4j.logger.org.parosproxy.paros=INFO log4j.logger.org.zaproxy.zap=INFO  Changing these to &amp;ldquo;DEBUG&amp;rdquo; (and restarting ZAP) will significantly increase the amount of logging performed:
log4j.logger.org.parosproxy.paros=DEBUG log4j.logger.org.zaproxy.zap=DEBUG  Logging can be selectively enabled using a Stand Alone script while ZAP is running (the example below is a JavaScript script):</description>

      <guid>/faq/how-do-you-configure-zap-to-test-an-application-on-localhost/</guid>
      <description>ZAP has no problems scanning applications running on localhost, however there are a couple of things you need to be aware of.
By default ZAP listens on port 8080. If your app also listens on 8080 then you&#39;ll need to change one of them to listen on a different port - it&#39;s probably easier to change ZAP using the Options Local Proxies screen, remember to change your browser&#39;s proxy settings as well: Configuring Proxies.</description>

-config api.key=12345 -config connection.timeoutInSecs=60  How can you find out what keys to use to set the values you want?
The keys are a dot notation of the XML used in the config.xml file.
One way to find out which value you need to change is:
 Start ZAP with a clean directory, e.g. ./zap.sh -dir test1 Close ZAP Start ZAP with another clean directory, e.</description>

      <description>First of all try checking the &amp;lsquo;Enable unsafe SSL/TLS renegotiation&amp;rsquo; checkbox in the Certificate Options screen and trying again.
Second check if you&#39;ve enabled SSLv2Hello in the outbound connection options. If so, disable SSLv2Hello and reload the content to see if the issue is resolved.
If this doesn&#39;t help and an HTTPS site reports a handshake failure then try installing the &amp;lsquo;Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files&amp;rsquo;:</description>

      <description>There are a number of ways to accomplish selective proxying.
1 - Via a Browser Add-on/Extension  Such as FoxyProxy: https://getfoxyproxy.org/  2 - Via Global Excludes  Leveraging Global Excludes you can specify URLs that ZAP should not intercept.  3 - Via a PAC (Proxy Auto-Config) File  You can create your own PAC (Proxy Auto-Config) file and dynamically set proxying as you need, then point your browser at it on your harddrive using the file:/// scheme.</description>

The solution is easy - use Java 9+
If you need to have multiple versions of Java on Windows then you may find it difficult to specify which one should be used. However changing the last line of the existing zap.bat batch file to specify the path to the right version of Java should solve this problem, e.</description>

      <description>You can use ZAP to perform security regression tests on your own products.
Note that this answer is very basic and WILL need to be improved ;)
You need to have installed Java and ZAP.
To launch ZAP from a Java program you can do something like:
ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder(&amp;#34;/home/myuser/fullpath/ZAP 2.9.0/zap.sh&amp;#34;); // full path to script, use zap.bat on Windows pb.directory(new File(&amp;#34;/home/myuser/fullpath/ZAP 2.9.0/&amp;#34;)); // directory where the script is in Process p = pb.</description>

      <description>ZAP understands API formats like JSON and XML and so can be used to scan APIs.
The problem is usually how to effectively explore the APIs.
There are various options:
 If your API has an OpenAPI/Swagger definition then you can import it using the OpenAPI add-on. If your API has a WSDL then you can import it using the SOAP Scanner add-on. If you have a list of endpoint URLs then you can import these using the Import files containing URLs add-on.</description>

      <description>Certificate pinning also known as Public Key Pinning &amp;ldquo;is a mechanism for sites to specify which certificate authorities have issued valid certs for that site, and for user-agents to reject TLS connections to those sites if the certificate is not issued by a known-good CA.&amp;rdquo;
Sites that use certificate pinning will typically not be loaded in your browser if you are proxying it through ZAP.
In Firefox you can change the about:config pref: &amp;lsquo;security.</description>

      <description>The information in this FAQ is based on details from: This user group thread
The Vaadin framework makes heavy use of JavaScript, so it seems the Ajax Spider is the way to go.
As you work to figure things out and get them configured correctly it makes sense to starting by proxying your browser through ZAP, identifying the http session and then flagging it as the &amp;lsquo;active session&amp;rsquo; before starting the Ajax Spider.</description>

      <description>When you proxy via ZAP you will often see that some of the Ids in the History tab are &amp;lsquo;missing&amp;rsquo;, e.g. it will jump from 1 to 4 etc.
The missing Ids do not refer to &amp;lsquo;hidden&amp;rsquo; requests that ZAP is making.
Instead those requests (which are not sent at all) are generated by ZAP for &amp;ldquo;internal&amp;rdquo; use only. They are used to show a &amp;ldquo;GET&amp;rdquo; request when &amp;ldquo;directory&amp;rdquo; nodes of the &amp;ldquo;Sites&amp;rdquo; tab, not yet (manually) accessed, are selected.</description>

      <description>If the Quick Start Attack fails with the message:
Failed to attack the URL, please check that the URL is valid  then the first thing to do is check your URL in a browser.
If it works ok then open the ZAP Manual Request Editor, replace the default URL with the one you are trying and send the request.
The response may well explain the problem.
Browsers will try variations of a URL that ZAP will not attempt, and we have also seen sites blocking ZAP scans based on the request signature.</description>

      <description>Since version 2.4.1 ZAP has required an API key by default in order to invoke API operations that make changes to ZAP. Since version 2.6.0 an API key is required by default in order to invoke any of the API operations. This is a security feature to prevent malicious sites from invoking the ZAP API. ZAP version 2.6.0 also introduced additional security options. All of the API security options, including the API key, can be found in the API Options screen.</description>
